# Relations

- [[Sets|set]] of ordered pairs
- has domain set and range set
- common domain and range

## Properties

- reflexive
	- $(x, x)$ is in relation for all $x$ in domain
- symmetric
	- if $(x, y)$ is in relation, then $(y, x)$ is also in relation
- antisymmetric
	- if $(x, y)$ is in relation, then $(y, x)$ is not in relation
- transitive
	- if $(x, y)$ and $(y, z)$ are in relation, then $(x, z)$ is also in relation

## Equivalence Relation

- reflexive
- symmetric
- transitive

## Partial Order

- reflexive
- antisymmetric
- transitive

## Total Order

- same as partial order but
- for any $x,y$, either $(x,y)$ is a relation or $(y,x)$ is a relation

# Graphs

- vertices and edges
- can be directed and undirected
- can be expressed by relations
