# Types

- parabola
- ellipse
- hyperbola

There are 2 definitions for a conic section.

# Cone Definition

Family of curves that can be formed by the intersection of a cone with a plane.

# Foci Definition

Based on two points (foci) and their distances ($r,r'$) to the curve.

## Ellipse

$$
r+r' = k
$$

OR

$$
r+r'=2a
$$

## Hyperbola

$$
|r-r'| = k
$$

## Parabola

$$
r = r'
$$

# Eccentricity

Conic sections can also be defined by the ratio, or **eccentricity** $e$ of the distance from a focus (fixed point) to a directrix (fixed line).

$$
e = \frac{FP}{QP}
$$

1. $0<e<1 \implies$ ellipse
2. $e = 1 \implies$ parabola
3. $e > 1 \implies$ hyperbola

Using the focus and directrix, we get a new equation for conic sections:

$$
r = \frac{ed}{1+e\cos\theta}.
$$
