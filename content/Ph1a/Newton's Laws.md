# Principle of Inertia

In the absence of force, an object stays at rest or in uniform motion. 

# Force Law

An object will accelerate proportionally to the force applied

$$
\vec{F}=m\vec{a}
$$

# Action/Reaction

The force exerted on object 1 by object 2 is equal and opposite to the force exerted on object 2 by object 1.

$$
\vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21}
$$

# Equilibrium of Forces

$$
\vec{F}= \sum_{i}\vec{F}_{i} = 0 = m\vec{a} \implies \vec{a}=0
$$

# Torque

$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = I\vec{\alpha}
,$$
