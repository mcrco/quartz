# Hydrostatics

- theory of liquids at rest
- no shear forces, thus
- law of hydrostatics: all stresses are normal to any surface inside the fluid

## Pressure

- normal force per unit area is **pressure**
- pressure stress is same in all directions

Pressure may vary as a function of position, ex. fluid at earth's surface $p\propto h\propto mg$ as shown below. If density $\rho$ is constant, then

$$
p(h) = p(0)-\rho gh.
$$
