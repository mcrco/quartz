# Definition

1. $f(x,y)$ has a **relative minimum** at the point $(a,b)$ if $f(x,y) \geq f(a,b)$ for all points $(x,y)$ in some region around $(a,b)$.

2. $f(x,y)$ has a **relative maximum** at the point $(a,b)$ if $f(x,y) \leq f(a,b)$ for all points $(x,y)$ in some region around $(a,b)$.



# Finding

Local extrema occur at critical points, which satisfy the following condition:
$$
\nabla f(a,b) = \vec{0}
$$

We must first find the gradient of the function and use the derived system of equations to find the critical points
