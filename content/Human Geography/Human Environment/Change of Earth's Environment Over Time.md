Short history of humans -> is now representative of before in Earth's history?
- Homo Sapiens ~ 200,000 years ago
- Everything in book ~ past 10,000 years.
- Did we fuck up bad or are these natural disasters today natural?

Alfred Wagner: continental drift and **Pangaea**
- evolved into plate tectonics and crustal spreading
- periodic for billions of years
- split up ~ 180M years ago

# Ocean and Atmosphere

## Formation of Ocean

- 70% of Earth is water
- Water rose to surface after formation?
- Maybe from outer space
	- icy comets?
	- Elsa magic?

## Formation of Atmosphere

- don't know how atmosphere was formed either
- CO$_{2}$ absorbed by ocean + plants
- ~800M years ago atmosphere -> habitable

# Fire and Ice

## Volcanoes

- volcanic eruption -> ash -> **mass depletion** (loss of diversity through failure to produce new species) -> **mass extinction** (mass destruction of most species)
- recent mass volcanism was ~180-160M years ago
	- continental separation
- **Pacific Ring of Fire**: ocean-girdling zone of crustal instability, volcanism, earthquakes
	- trace of Pangaea separation
- 73,500 years ago: Mount Toba eruption -> destroyed much genetic diversity in humans

## Ice Age

- Ice Age -> greatest extinction
- usually accompanied by periods of heat
- Pleistocene Era deep freeze
	- long **glaciation**
		- permanent ice deep into landmasses in North
		- no habitat
		- 100,000 years
		- **Wisconsin Glaciation** most recent
			- smart humans survived
			- tools in hunting/fishing/gathering communities + language
	- short, warm **interglaciation**
		- ~120,000 years ago -> humans
		- **Holocene** after Wisconsin
		- Global warming ~18000 years ago
			- Mud floods across Mississipi Valley -> delta

# Little Ice Age

- 14th century
- cold
- decreased rainfall
- winds
- shortened growing seasons
- stormy seas
- advancing glaciers in Greenland and Iceland
- famines in Europe
- ended in 1850
- just minor glaciation

## Impact on Humans

- humanity almost fucked
- famines in Europe
- Mongols thrived -> dynasty in China and empire
	- brought Black Death to weakened Europe

### China

- huge fleet under Ming empire
	- 315 ships
	- 27000 people
	- hella trade, almost everywhere
- eventually fucked by Little Ice Age
	- no rain -> famine
	- ships had to stop

### Tambora

- destroyed islands
- debris over entire Indonesia
- global famine
