2.5M types of organisms on earth. Humans have greatest impact

# Alterations of Ecosystems

- wartime forest defoliation
- oil spills
- ancient fire to kill reindeer/bison
- hunting mammals to extinction
- Maori in NZ
- Polynesias reduce forest cover and regional birds
- Europeans killed Galapagos turtles and African species for fashion

# Environmental Stress

Environmental stress is the act of humans stressing environemnt

- deforestation
- pollutants
- toxic groundwater
- garbage in oceans
- canals

# Water

**Renewable source**: resources that are replenished

Water is renewable but fresh water is not evenly distributed.

- sustained through **hydrologic cycle** - rain and snow from oceans -> landmasses
- kept in aquifers (water rocks)
	- not safe, overuse -> saltwater gets in
- 3/4 of fresh water used is for farming
	- California has debate for city vs farms (outsource food?)
- chemical pesticide -> groundwater poisoned
- water sources are uncertain

## Politics in Middle East

Israel consumes 3x as much water as neighbors
- water sources conquered from neighbors
- bad relationship with Palestinian neighbors

# Atmosphere

Thin lyaer of air lying above land and oceans. 

Very resilient
- Krakatau and St. Helen were cleaned up p fast
- still gets gg10d by humans tho with industrialization

## Global Warming

- tropospheric pollution
- greenhouse gases -> temps up
- up to 3.7 Celsius uip -> glacial ice, sea levels rise 6 inches
- greenhouse gases rise 2% per decade

## Acid Rain

- pollutants in atmosphere -> acid rain formed by SO2 and NO are released by burning of fossil fuels
- wind flow -> acid rain patterns

# Land

## Deforestation

- trees are important for oxygen cycle
- in 1980's 44% of tropical rainforests suffered and 1% logged every year -> gone in 90 years
- decreased somewhat by 2005
- still not completely understood

## Waste

- solid waste
- sanitary landfill
- toxic waste
- radioactive waste

# Biodiversity

- diversity of all aspects of life
- threatened
	- 8% of plants
	- 5% of fish
	- 11% of birds
	- 18% of mammals
- 650 species of plants and 480 animal in last 400 years
