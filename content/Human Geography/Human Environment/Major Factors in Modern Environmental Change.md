Impact of humans is increasing
- population growth
- consumption increase
- technology

# Political Ecology

Views on who is doing damage differs with scale
- Global: poor do more damage
- Local: poor use organic materials, wealthy ones use pesticide -> wealthy become wealthier

# Population

Disaster affects rich and poor and populated/less populated differently
- rich: financial
- poor: loss of lives and financial

# Patterns of Consumption

Modern humans require so much more resources than hunter gatherer -> globalized needs for consumption
- especially true for core
	- US person 250x more energy than Bangladeshi person
- growth in periphery -> local impact
- growth in core -> global impact

# Technology

- energy to travel
- pollution of tech
- allows for global damage fast

# Tranportation

- resource use scales with population
- facilitates consumption

## Energy

- 46M barrels per day in 1970 -> 73.27M barels in 2007
- 75% of Middle East economy
	- Kuwait needs water instead -> desalinization

### Alternative Energy

- EU heavily funds ECU for wind parks in Navarra in Spain
