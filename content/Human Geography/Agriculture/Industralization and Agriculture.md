# Spatial Layout of Agriculture

- Thunen noticed distance from city -> different crops
- Von Thunen model: concentric circles of agriculture
	- central city

		- perishable goods
	- forest
		- fuel and building
	- field crops
		- non perishable
	- ranching, livestock

	- didn't help Africa as much
- cons

	- super pests
	- pesticide and chemical fertlizer -> bad groundwater
	- subsistence farmers suffer

# New GMOs

- 75% of processed food in US
	- 38% corn
	- 80% of soybeans
- resistance due to health/taste
- "foreign idea invasion"

# Regional and Local Change

- Latin America
	- cash crops -> low local consumption crop production
	- subsistence farming -> marginal lands
- Asia
	- Green Revolution -> cereal crops
	- small production, manual labor
- Subsaharan Africa
	- exports decreased
	- small and manual labor
- women are oppressed even though they do all the manual work
	- 85% in Africa
