- agriculture: deliberate tending of crops and livestock to produce food, feed, and fiber
- > 50% of crops in US are for livestock

There are different types of economic activities:

1. **primary economic activities**: products close to ground
	- agriculture
2. **secondary economic activities**: processing/manufacturing
3.  **tertiary economic activities**: services

How these activities, such as agriculture, are produced ([[Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory|core or periphery methods]]) and its proportion in the total production of a country and its labor force ([[Defining and Measuring Development|GDP, GNI, etc...]]) tells us about the development of a country.

- US agriculture prodcution is highlighy mechanized
	- employment at its lowest, production at highest
	- clearly core

# Hunting, Gathering, Fishing

- pre-agriculture activities
- specialized based on region
- size of clans depended on climate and resources

# Terrain and Tools

- tools were necessary for hunting and gathering
- controlled use of fire -> lighting, cooked food, etc...
- led to communities and migration

# First Agricultural Revolution

- Carl Sauer: agriculture was created in lands of plenty
- plant domestication began ~ 14,000 years ago in SE Asia
	- root crops were first
	- seed crops in Fertile Crescent
	- started FAR
- domestication -> plants bigger -> more food -> larger communities
- agricultural methods diffused
	- millet from West Africa -> India, sorghum -> China
	- corn -> Central America -> NA
	- potato -> Europe from Andean highlands

# Domestication of Animals

- goats, pigs, sheep domesticated around same time as plants
	- goats in Fertile Crescent
	- sheep in turkey
- started when people became more sedentary
- reasons:
	- ceremony
	- scavengers
	- protection
	- pets
- advantages:
	- milk
	- meat
- diffused quickly
- domestication -> docile animals -> animals get smaller over time
- similar species domesticated simultaneously in different places
- ongoing effort
	- if possible it would've happened long ago
	- diet, growth rate, breeding, disposition, social structure, size all matter

# Hunter Gatherers in the Modern World

- pressure to change because of globalized economy
- [[Spatial Organization of State Governments|territorial states]] -> no migration
- even no migration -> studied, mapped, recorded, commercialized, exploited

# Subsistence Agriculture in Modern World

- **subsistence farming**: farming only what you eat
- poor
- way of life + state of mind
- commonly owned land, very egalitarian society
- **shifting cultivation**: migration for better farmland
	- mainly in tropics in periphery
	- low population density
	- **slash and burn agriculture**: controleld use of fire to destroy vegetation -> ashes -> farming
	- pretty sustained for thousands of years

## Marginalization of Subsistence Farming

- colonialism -> Europeans force modernization of colonial farming
- planned out what to grow
- severe famines + disruption of local economies
- modernization -> destruction of subsistence farming +communities + increase wealth gap
