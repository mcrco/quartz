To study distribution of cities, geographers look at 3 key traits: population, trade area, and distance. 

**Trade area** is the adjacent region within which the city is dominant. Example is Green Country around Tulsa, OK.

These 3 features create a sort of hiearchy between cities. For example, San Francisco/San Jose would be the dominant city here since they have large trade areas and populations.

**Rank size rule** states that population of city should be inversely proportional to place in hiearchy, unless there is one immensely influential city in a country, like Mexico or France.[

# Central Place Theory

Walter Christaller laid the foundation for CPT when explaining where cities, towns, and villages are likely to be located.

Assumptions for ideal region:
1. Flat land
2. Consistent soil fertility
3. Evenly distributed population/purchasing power
4. Thorough transportation
5. Accessible goods

Central place should be nested -> easy to provide to auxiliary locations. Therefore, centers of cities should be centers of goods so they can maintain monopoly of certain goods in trade area.

# Hexagonal Hinterlands

Hexagonal regions are best model of cities and trade areas and held true in some places very well.

Examples of it working:
- North China Plain and Sichuan Basin are flat ground. 
	- G. William Skinner said areas fit model
- US Midwest had similar economic forces

# Central Places Today

Internet has changed the world -> CPT might not hold true. However, it still explains many phenomena.

## Sunbelt Phenomenom

- Millions of Americans move from N/NE states to S/SW states because of governmental policies favoring cities in "Sunbelt" with federal spending
- Demonstrates how big cities will increase technological goods in accordance with CPT to maintain power/go up in hiearchy
