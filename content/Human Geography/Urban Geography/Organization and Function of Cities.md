# Models of the City

Every model studies the **functional zonation** of cities (division of cities into regions for functions).

**Zones** refer to areas with same function. Key economic zone is **central business district** aka downtown concentration of business/commerce with skyscrapers and whatnot. 

**Central cities** are non-suburban urban areas aka old city and contain 30% of population. **Suburbs** are functional areas adjacent to centr[

**Suburbanizatoin** is the process by which lands outside of urban area -> urbanized as people and business from city move there, transforming large areas of land and isolating wealthyprimate citi people. 

# Modeling NA City

## Concentric Zone Model

Developed by Ernest Burgess.

5 zones:
1. CBD: financial, retail, theater
2. Residential deterioriation/business and light manufacturing
3. Blue collar labor force
4. Middle class
5. Surburban ring

Model is dynamic; CBD can invade Zone 2, which invades Zone 3.

## Sector Model

Developed by Homer Hoyt.

City grows outwards from center -> low-rent area from CBD to outer edge -> pie shaped zones.
- low, intermediate, high rent residentials
- education/recreation
- transportation
- industrial

## Others

Multiple nuclei model: CBD is losing dominance -> multiple nuclei

Most models are too simple to describe modern cities because of transportation and ring roads in 70s and 80s. Outer cities and suburbs now have separate economy -> edge cities. These then developed and surpaseed central cities in employment.

**Urban realm** describes spatial components of modern metropolis, where each realm is a separate economic, social, and politcal entity that forms a metropolis. Demonstrates how outer cities now influence central cities.
