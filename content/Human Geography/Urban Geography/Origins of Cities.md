A **city** is a conglomeration of people and buildings clustered together to serve as a center of politics, culture and economics.

Urbanization is happening globally -> global population is predominantly **urban** (near central city/suburbs). 4 out of 5 people in many developed nations live in cities/towns. In China/India, it is 4 out of 10.

Urbanization happens fast, such as in Shenzhen, where the population went from 20k to 3.1M in just 30 years after China establish an SEZ there.

# Hearths of Urbanization

Before cities, there were agricultural villages in small egalitarian societies with permanent populations, such as those in the Indus River Valley and Mesoamerica.

**Agricultural surplus** and **social stratification** -> formation of cities. The creation of a leadership class/urban elite -> religion and philsophy -> writing. The growth of cities in this process is the first urban revolution, which occured in the 5 hearths.
