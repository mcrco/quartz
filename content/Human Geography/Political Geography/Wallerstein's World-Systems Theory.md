World-Systems Theory is a theory of the world economy proposed by Immanuel Wallerstein. It states that it to understand any state, we must understand its spatial and functional relationships within world economy.

# 3 Tenets

## One market and a global division of labor.

Development of world economy began with capitalist exchange around 1450, globalized by 1900. Producers commodify anything they can.
- **Capitalism**: every in world economy and beyond is driven by achieving profit -> seeking cheapest labor and cheapest products with highest quality
- **Commodificiation**: placing price on good and trading it
Capitalism + commodificiation -> 1 market, global division of labor

## Multiple states but everything happens in global context

Colonialism -> global context. Independent states are possible, but independent economies are not possible.

## 3 Tier Structure

Core and periphery are defined as processes, but some places can be labelled as such as well

1. **Core**: processes that incorporate high education, high salaries, high tech, high consumption, more wealth
2. **Periphery**: processes that incorporate low levels of every factor above
3. **Semiperiphery**: places where both core and periphery processes occur
	Core usually exploits the periphery. Semiperiphery acts as a buffer bewteen core and periphery -> no polarization into two extremes

# Effects

World-systems theory explains how colonial powers amassed large wealth.
Mercantilism -> first wave of colonialism -> extracting goods from America and slave labor from Africa.
Industrial Revolution -> second wave of colonialism -> cheap industrial labor, raw materials, plantations
