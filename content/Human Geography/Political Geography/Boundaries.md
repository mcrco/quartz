# Overview

Boundaries separate states territories.

Subsoil resources -> dispute.
- European coal reserves from Belgium to Netherlands to Germany -> fighting
	-  1950s: Germany vs Netherland b/c natural
- Iraq vs Kuwait b/c oil in Rumaylah reserve -> Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990
	- international crisis

Boundaries in airspace/space -> more potential disputes.

# Establishing Boundaries

1. *Define* boundaries through treaty-like document
2. *Delimit* boundary on map
3. *Demarcate* along boundary using physical barrier
4. *Administrate* boundary

# Types of Boundaries

**geometric boundary**: boundaries drawn with grid system like latitude/longitude/township/range
- US and Canada use latitude west of Great Lakes
- Berlin Conference was random for Africa

**physical-political / natural-political boundary**: boundaries made from physical geography
- Rio Grande between US and Mexico
- Pyrenees between Spain and France
- Lakes in Africa
- unstable
	- Argentina and Chile

# Boundary Disputes

All boundaries have complex beginnings (old, imprecise, ancient, set by formerly dominant countries, changed with geography).

## Definitional Boundary Disputes

- Focus on legal language of boundary agreement
- Ex: change in river tide level -> dispute over resources in river, land uncovered by river
- Must redefine definition -> suit both parties

## Locational Boundary Disputes

- Focus on delimitation/demarcation of boundary
	- different interpretations of vague boundary treaty
- Ex: colonial powers in Africa/Asdia didn't define international administrative boundaries -> arguments when they became independent states
- Sometimes there is no defintion of boundary
	- Saudi Arabia vs Yemen for oil

## Operational Boundary Disputes

- involve neighbors who differ eover the way their border should funciton
- examples
	- one state wants migration, other doesn't
	- smuggling prevention efforts are uncoordinated/contradictory
	- nomads move across border with livestock

## Allocational Boundary Disputes

- caused by resources
- examples
