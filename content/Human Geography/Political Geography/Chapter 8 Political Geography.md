## Independence

- first black African colony -> independent in 1960

	- still stuck in world econ, unable to control their own econ
- Nkrumah was overthrown by military in 1966 and died in 1972
- example of small country wanting independence but inherting shit government and setup cuz Europe regions work for Europe economy and based on European political orgnaization of space
- political activity is just as crucial to culture as language or religion
