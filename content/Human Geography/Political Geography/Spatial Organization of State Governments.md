1950s: Richard Hartshorne said forces within state that unify are **centripetal**, forces within state that divide are **centrifugal**. Balance of both -> state exists.
Cannot conclude if one thing is either/or.
- Examples: 
	- war can unify -> centripetal, after war internal struggle -> centrifugal
	- language 
	- politics
- Factors: timing, scale, interaction, perspective

Government tries to unify through
- nation-building
- structuring government -> melds nations within state
- defining and defending boundaries
- expressing territorial control

Geography impacts governance.

# Form of Government

Form of government can promote nation building and ease tensions.

## Unitary Government

- Dominated EU til end of WW2
- centralized at capital city
	- capital culture = national culture
	- France had 90 departments, central laws -> region, not other way around
- didn't serve minorities 
	- small nations suppressed
		- Brittons in France
		- Basques in Spain
			- help by including more in national assembly

## Federal System

- central + state government
- strong -> states strong, weak -> central strong
- Nigeria
	- 36 states have own judicial system
	- Muslim North has Shari'a
	- Christian/animist South does not
- US separates federal and state laws
- doesn't always work: USSR, Yugo, Czech, Belgium

## Devolution

Devolution is the movement of power from the central government to the regional governments within the state.
- federalism
- testing out new stuff without changing constitution
	- Britain and North Ireland Assembly
- arise from [ethnocultural](###ethnocultural-devolutionary-movements), [economic](###Economic), and [spatial](###Spatial) forces

### Ethnocultural Devolutionary Movements

Ethnicity, language, religion -> devolutionary movements. 
- Czechoslovakia
	- peaceful devolution
	- Slovakia discriminate against 11% Hungarians -> push for autonomy
- Yugoslavia
- Lithuania and Ukraine
- Russia vs Moldova and Kalingrad
- Sudan
	- Muslim North, non-Muslim South
- Srik Lanka
	- Singhalese (Buddhist) vs Tamil (Hindu) independence
- China
	- Tibet, Ughyur
- UK and Scotland are peaceful, even evolutionary b/c EU support small groups
	- still want to secede because Brexit and EU market is important

### Economic Devolutionary Forces

Devolutionary pressure comes from variety of sources.

#### Catalonia
- ethnocultural
- economic
	- 6% area, 17% population, but 25% exports for Spain
	- nationalism

#### Italy and France
- Sardinia b/c economic neglect by Rome
- North/South disparity
	- North = European core
	- Mezzogiorno region in South below Ancona Line = European periphery
- Northern League: indpendent state of Padania north of Po River -> federalism

#### Brazil
- 1990s: Rio Grande, Santa Catarina, Paran in south wanted separation b/c taxes -> Amazonia in North
- Pampas

### Spatial Influences on Devolution

Distance/geographical barries -> devolution.
- islands
- Hawaii
	- not enough economic power

## Electoral Geography

Electoral districts are big part of internal poli-geo. Ex: 1994: South Africa provides majority rules but gives power to 9 new states.

**Gerrymandering**: redrawing voting region border to help a party

**Majority/minority district**: majority of population in district is a minority overall
