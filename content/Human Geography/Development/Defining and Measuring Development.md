- Wealth is a function of what, how, and where.
- **Development**: progress made in technology, production, socioeconomic welfare

# Gross National Incowme

- GNP measures total value of officially recorded goods and services produced by citizens/corporations of a country in a year (includes inside and outside country)
- GDP measures only inside of country
- GNI is GDP + income from outside of country
- per capita: standardization of above measures
- Examples
	- Japan: per capita GNI of $31,410
	- US: per capita GNI of $41,950
	- Indian: 3460
	- Nigeria: 1040
	- Indonesia: 3720
- GNI only measures **formal economy**, or legal economy
- **informal economy** keeps people in countries w/ low GNI pc alive
- GNI does not count for internal disparity
	- UAE has per capita GNI > 24k, but
		- Abu Dhabi: >50% of GDP
		- Dubai: 25% GDP
		- Qaywayn: <1%
- GNI doesn't count for harm done by products -> alternative measurements

## Alternative Measurements

- occupational structure of labor: people in farming vs people in tech jobs
- productivity per worker: production per capita
- transportation and communication facilities per person: infrastructure for econ per capita
- dependency ratio: ratio of dependents to employed
	- bad demographic -> high dr
- other measurements from before
	- literacy rate
	- infant mortality
	- etc
- still do not account for different levels of development within a state

# Development  Models

Different couyntries develop differently: take Japan (agrarian -> industrial) vs Sudan for example.

Criticisms of development models:
- Western bias in indicators of development (industry can hurt poor countries)
- doesn't consider geography/interrelations
- treates states as autonomous (goes against [[Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory]])

## Rostow's Modernization Model

### 5 stages of development

1. traditional
	- farming
	- rigid social strucutre
	- conservative tech
2. preconditions
	- new leader -> progressive
3. takeoff
	- kinda industrial revolution
	- sustained growth
	- urbanization + industrialization
4. drive to maturity
	- tech diffusion
	- industrial specialization
	- international trade expand
5. high mass consumption
	- high production + income
	- majority of work is services
	- core

### Shortcomings

- climbing up ladder is function of many nations not just one
- international position
- cultural differences
- industrialization not necessarily good
	- foreign investment -> foreign benefits
	- environment damage
