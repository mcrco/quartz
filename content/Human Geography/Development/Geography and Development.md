Development needs context at local, regional, global scale
- global
	- European idea of stae -> world into capitalism
	- **neo-colonialism**: core controls periphery despite not being colonies
	- **structuralist theory**: rigid, large-scale economic arrangements shape future -> hard for poor countries to improve economy
		- different set of development circumstances than [[Defining and Measuring Development|Rostow's Model]]

# Dependency Theory

- international political and economic relationships limit economic development possibilities of poorer areas
	- neo-colonialism is good example
- adoption of superpower currency
	- El Salvador and US dollar
		- 2M El Salvadorians in US
		- 2B in remittances to home country
- low probability of economic prosperity in dependent regions

# Geography and Context (World-Systems Theory)

- economic development must be seen in context of [[Wallerstein's World-Systems Theory]]
	- basically core earns money and periphery suffers and semi-periphery is where core gets to watch periphery suffer
- fundamentally different from modernization model because not all places can be equally wealthy (must have 3 tiers at all times)
- power relations and economic development is different for every tier (geographically sensitive)
