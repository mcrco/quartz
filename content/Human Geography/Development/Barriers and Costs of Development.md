# Barriers to Economic Development

## Social Conditions

- health
	- high birth rate
	- high infant mortality
	- low life expectancy
	- young population -> dependency ratio
	- no sewage
	- no health care
- education
	- not free
	- gendered
		- girls marry
		- trafficking
	- high illiteracy

## Foreign Debt

- decolonization -> foreign banks and World Bank and IMF lend new states money for development
	- structural adjustment loans: money in exchange for economic reform
- debt is impossible to pay back due to project failure/not enough tax revenue
- **neoliberalism**: laissez-faire economics, governmen intervention is inefficient and undesirable
	- economic control from states -> private sectors.
	- economic globalization
	- expansion of corporate control
	- Argentina got fricked in 2001 by neoliberalism + debt

## Disease

- very damaging to developing countries because of amplified effect in poor conditions and to workforce
- **vectored diseases**: spread by one host to another host or vector
	- warm, humid periphery/semiperiphery
	- **malaria**: infectious disease of mosquito
		- 150k children in periphery per month
		- tsunami has 300k children at once
		- most are < 5 yo
		- kill mosquitoes to eradicate 
		- Sri Lanka DDT
			- carcinogen in nature
		- India failed to fully eradicate

## Political Instability

- not in UN Millenium Goals
- wealth gap
	- Kenya: 10% controls 40% of wealth -> 2007-2008 turmoil
- core can establish democracy, others can't without wealth
	- Taliban in Afghanistan
	- political corruption in Zimbabwe after bad harvest
		- Mugabe kills competitors
		- Superpower boycott aid -> commoners suffer

# Cost of Economic Development

- industrial production -> air and water pollution
- agriculture -> pesticides and herbicides
- tourism -> taxing on infrastructure

## Industrialization

- **export processing zones**: special zones w/ favorable tax, regulatory, and trade arrangements for foreign firms
	- in 60 countries by 2000s
	- near ports
	- Mexican **maquiladoras**
		- northern Mexico
		- sent to US free of tariffs
		- 80% of goods to US
		- 1980s: wage differences -> high usage
		- 3000 today, 1M workers, 45% of Mexican exports
		- bad for environment
		- young men and women
		- horrible conditions
		- NAFTA
			- Tijuana
			- Ciudad Juarez
	- Chinese **special economic zones**

## Agriculture

- periphery produces for foreign markets
- no benefit for locals due to 
	- bad organization
	- too expensive
	- fragmented land ownership
	- inefficient tools
	- low-protein crops
	- debt
- poor farmers ->
	- soil erosion
	- **desertification**
		- Africa
			- > 50% is arid
			- semiarid land -> farm/ranch -> intense use -> desertification

## Tourism

- wealth and employment but
	- facilities owned by foreign companies
	- local jobs are low-paying and insecure
- narrow in scope and time
	- overreliance -> vulnerable when change occurs (COVID)
	- rich tourist attractions, poor local citizens
- bad for culture and environment
	- demonstration effect hurts local culture
- big investments
	- imports of materials and equipment strain supply
	- funds -> foreign entertainment, not local housing
