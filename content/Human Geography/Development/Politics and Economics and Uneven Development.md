- poverty can occur in core
	- Pine Ridge
		- 60% in poverty
		- per capita income of 6000
	- rich coastal China vs poor interior provinces
- many political and social consequences of wealth gap

# Role of Governments

- tariffs, trade agreements, taxation, land ownership rules, environmental regulations -> distribution of wealth
- Hurrican Katrina destroyed Ninth Ward in New Orleans
	- government built levies and allowed settlement in flood-prone areas

# Islands of Development

- governments prioritize capital cities
	- no benefit, just showing off
	- creates primate cities
- some countries have new capital cities to separate from colonial past
	- Nigeria: Lagos -> ethnically neutral Abuja
	- Pakistan: Karachi -> Islamabad (historically important interior/north)
	- Brazil: RdJ -> Brasilia to focus on sparsely populated, poor interior
- can be created by corporations who focus on certain cities
	- Gabon in Africa
		- Elf and Shell
		- "oil city"

	- **microcredit programs** in South Asian and South America give loans to poor, especially women
		- alter gender balance
