# Introduction

Timbuktu used to be a wealthy African hub but now looks like a homeless shelter. This was due to a shift in maritime trade routes => position relative to economic development >= products produced.

To understand value of products, we need to analyze the **commodity chain**, which is a series of links connecting the many places of production and distribution of commodities. Wealth is distributed unevenly along the steps of production (core vs periphery). For this reason, one problem of development is about transforming peripheral proesses into core ones.
