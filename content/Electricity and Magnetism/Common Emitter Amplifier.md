## Input and Output

- input characteristics: $V_{be}, I_{b}$
- output characteristics; $V_{ce}, I_{c}$

## Biasing the Transistor

- biasing: running DC current through the 3 terminals of a transistor to set its [[Bipolar Junction Transistor#Regions of Operation|region of operation]] and operating point or q-point
- $V_{cc}$ flows to $R_{1}$
- $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ acts as a voltage divider
- $V_{b} = V_{cc}\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}$

## Beta

- $V_{c} \propto V_{cc} \propto V_{b} \implies I_{b} = \beta I_{c}$
- $\beta = \text{hfe}$ on transistor label

## Demonstration

Given $R_{L} = 1.2k\Omega$ and $V_{cc}=12\text{V}$
