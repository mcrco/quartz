# Quantum Picture of Chemical Bond

As 2 $H$ atoms approach each other,

- effective potential energy curve is caused by repulsive forces between nuclei, attractive forces between nuclei and electrons, and repulsive forces between electrons
- lower energy = more stable $\implies$ understanding potential energy is key to understanding molecule
- above picture of two hydrogen atoms can also be interpreted as the merging of wave functions of electrons

- can mathematically calculate effective potential energy using

# Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

- electrons move much faster than nuclei
- assume nuclei are fixed in space when solving Schrodinger's equation

$$
2\sigma_{u}^{*}
$$

- 2: integer that tracks relative energies for each symetry type
- $\sigma$: descirbes orientation around internuclear axis
	- $\sigma$: cylindrical symmetry
	- $\pi$: $\Psi$ has nodal plane that contains internuclear axis
- $u$: describes inversion symmetry
	- $u$: ungerade, $g$: gerade
- \*: node on internuclear axis
