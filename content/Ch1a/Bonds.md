- holds atoms together
- change the properties
- care about nature of bond and resulting shapes
	- example: graphene vs polyethylene
	- insert hexagon vs chain

## Ionic Bond

- complete transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another
- has dipoles
- formed between 2 atoms of differing electronegativity ($\Delta \text{EN} > 2$)
- example: $NaCl$. electron goes from Na to. Cl
	- IE of Na is 495.8
	- IE of Cl is 1251.2 
	- Cl is 3p orbital but less energy than Na because increased number of protons, but not increased principle quantum number (distance from nucleus)
- atoms that form ions w/ noble gas configurations are very stable
	- NaCl is example once again
	- Na -> Ne, Cl -> Ar
		- $Na \to Na^{+} + e^{-}$, $Cl + e^{-} = Cl^{-}$
	- 8 electorns in valence shell
	- octet rule: atoms with 8 electrons around them are stable
	- general rule
		- Group 1 likes to lose electron -> $A^{+}$
		- Group 2 likes to lose 2 electrons -> $A^{2+}$
		- Group 3 likes to lose 3 electrons -> $A^{3+}$
		- Group 6 likes to gain 2 electrons -> $A^{2-}$
		- Group 7 likes to gain electron -> $A^{-}$

To calculate the change of energy when K bonds with F,

$$
\begin{gather*}
K \to K^{+} + e^{-}, \Delta E = IE_{1}=419 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
e^{-} + F \to F^{-}, \Delta E = -EA = -328 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
V_{\infty} = \Delta E_{\infty} \\
V(R_{KF}) = \frac{q_{K}q_{F}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}R_{KF}} + V_{\infty} \\
\end{gather*}
$$

Basically, the potential energy for a distance of $R_{KF}$ between the two ions in terms of Joules per ion pair is the above. To get it in $\frac{kJ}{mol}$, we need to multiply by Avogadro's number and divide by 1000.

$$
V(R_{KF}) = \frac{q_{K}q_{F}(}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}R_{KF}}\left( \frac{N_{A}}{10^{3}} \right) + V_{\infty}

$$


## Covalent Bonds

- $\Delta \text{EN} < 0.4$
- electrons are shared evenly

## Polar-Covalent Bonds

- gray area between ionic and covalent
- somewhat closer to one atom than another


Let's consider the simple molecule H2

- forms of energy
	- potential: energy due to position or composition
	- kinetic: motion
 
# Energy

Let's consider the simple molecule $H_{2}$.

## Potential Energy

- energy due to composition or position

$$
V = V_{en}+V_{e e } + V_{nn}
$$

- $V_{en}$ is attractive
- $V_{e e} + V_{nn}$ are repulsive

$$
V = \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{1a}} + \frac{1}{r_{2a}} + \frac{1}{r_{1B}} + \frac{1}{r_{2B}} \right) + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{12}} \right) + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{R_{AB}} \right)
$$

## Total Energy

$$
E = \sum \text{KE}_{e} + \sum \text{KE}_{n} + V
$$

## Morse Potential

Morse potential curve describes the potential energy in a diatomic bond as a function of the radius. The basic version looks like the diagram below.

![[Pasted image 20231020211919.png]]

When the $r<r_{eq}$, the repulsion force between the electrons of one atom and another and the repulsion of the nuclei of each atom generate high potential energy. Then, as $r>r_{eq}$ the attractive force between the electrons of one atom and the nucleus of the other is what increases potential energy.

Below is a diagram for an ionic bond. 

![[Pasted image 20231025225747.png]]

- strong ionic bond
- the potential energy is less at $r_{eq}$ since the bond is super stable
- $r_{eq}$ is shorter because stronger bond
- potential energy is larger because of energy required to ionize both ions in the bond

# Bond Descriptors

## Bond Length

- distance between 2 atoms
- shorter -> stronger

## Energy

- $\Delta E_{d}$ larger = more stable
- reproducible from molecule to molecule
- C-O $\Delta E_{d}$ is $\pm 10\%$
- O-H  $\Delta \epsilon = 465 \frac{kJ}{mol}$

## Order

- number of shared electrons between 2 pairs of atoms
- more electrons = stronger = shorter distance

## Polarity

- absolute value of the difference in electronegativity between 2 bonded atoms
	- large difference > 2 => ionic
	- small < 0.4 => covalent
	- in between 0.4 -> 2 => polar covalent
- $H^{\delta+}-F^{\delta-}$: $\Delta = |2.2-3.98| = 1.78$
- $\delta$
	- fraction of charge on each atom
	- $q=\delta e$ is total charge
	- $\delta$ is 1 and 0 for ionic bond
	- measurable
		- $\mu = (\frac{R}{0.2082 \mathcal{A}})\delta$ is dipole moment in debye
		- $R$ is bond length in $\mathcal{A}$
		- for HF, $\mu=1.82\text{D}, R=0.917\mathcal{A} \implies \delta = 1.82\text{D}(\frac{0.2082\mathcal{A}}{0.917\mathcal{A}}=0.41$ ionic
  
# Oxidation Number/States

- oxidation numbers: ~~fictitious~~ charges on each atom in molecule
	- $Cr^{3+}$ good for you, $Cr^{6+}$ gives you cancer
	- $Co^{3+} \to Co^{4+} + e^{-}$ powers phones

## Rules

1. number of atoms in neutral molecular must add to charge of ion (0 if neutral)
2. alkali-metal atoms = +1, alkaline earth atoms = +2 b/c noble gas
3. $F=-1$ above all (unless $F_{2}$) and halogens = $-1$ because noble gas (unless other halides or $O$)
4. $H=+1$ unless alkali metal then $H=-1$
5. $O=-2$ unless with $F$ (rule 3)
