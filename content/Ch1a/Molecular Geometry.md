# Lewis Dot

- predicts structural formula -> sequence of atoms [[Bonds|bonded]]
- diagrams with like formal charges on adjacent atoms -> unstable
- opposite formal charges on adjacent atoms are good

1. draw atom with valence $e^{-}$
2. octet rule: main group surrounded by $8e^{-}$
	- 2 in s orbital, 6 in p orbital
	- exception is $H$, $He$ (surrounded by 2)

3. assign formal charge

## Exceptions

### Ozone

- unstable
- rekt by CFC
- bond length not predicted by lewis dot
- resonance hybrid
	- both bonds are 1.5 order

### Other

1. odd $e^{-}$ molecules (NO)
	![[Pasted image 20231019111618.png]]
2. octet-deficient molecules ($BF_{3}$)
	![[Pasted image 20231019111653.png]]
 3. valence shell expansion (3rd period and down)

# Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR)

- predicts shape of molecule based on Lewis Dot structure
- electron pairs repel
- 3 aspects that effect reactivity
	- bond length
	- size/shape
	- bond angles
	- dihedral angle
- geometry based off of nuclear coordinates
	- steric number (SN): number of atoms bonded to central atom and lone pair

| Molecule | Steric No | Predicted Geometry                                   | Example  |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| $AX_{2}$ | 2         | Linear ![[Pasted image 20231019112857.png]]          | $CO_{2}$ |
| $AX_{3}$ | 3         | Trigonal Planar ![[Pasted image 20231019112923.png]] | $BF_{3}$ |
| $AX_{4}$ | 4         | Tetrahedral ![[Pasted image 20231019112955.png]]     | $CF_{4}$ |
| $AX_{5}$ | 5         | Trigonal Bipyramidal ![[Pasted image 20231019113020.png]]                                 | $PF_{5}$ |
| $AX_{6}$ | 6         | Octahedra ![[Pasted image 20231019113043.png]]                                            | $SF_{6}$ |

- lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs
- dissimilar atoms cause different repulsions
	- $Cl$ attracts $e^{-}$ away from $C$ reduces repuulsion
	- electropositive repels more than electronegative atoms

# Dipole moment

- unequal distribution of $e^{-}$, vector
- good example: $H_{2}O$
- bad example: $C Cl_{4}$
	- nonpolar
