Chemistry is about
- understanding the link between atomic structure, bonding, and properties.
- rxn -> structures and electrons change

# Two Fundamental Building Blocks

- matter
	- conservation of matter: matter cannot be created or destroyed
- energy
	- conservation of energy: energy cannot be created or detroyed
	- can be converted

# Dalton's Atomic Theory of Matter

1. Matter consists of indivisible atom
2. All atoms of given element are identical in mass + properties
3. Atoms are indestructible and retain IDs during reaction
4. Atoms can combine to make compounds

# Subparticles

## [[Electrons in Atoms]]

- $e^{-}$
- $9.11\cdot 10^{-31}\text{ kg}$
- forms cloud around nucleus in orbitals

## Nucleus 

- proton
	- $p^{+}$
	- $1.67\cdot 10^{-27}\text{ kg}$
- neutron
	- $n$
	- $1.67\cdot 10^{-27}\text{ kg}$
- mass number: sum of number of $p^{+}$ and number of $n$
	- $^{39}K$
	- defines isotope
- atomic number: number of $p^{+}$ 
	- $_{19}K$
	- defines element

# Relation to mass

- need to correlate atoms to mass
- use Avogadro's Number
	- $N_{A}=6.022\cdot 10^{23}$
	- 1 mol = $N_{A}$ molecules, atoms, entities
- atomic mass units (amu)
	- unit of mass for atomic and molecular weights
	- $\frac{1}{12}$ of $^{12}C$ atom mass
	- $1.66 \cdot 10^{-27} kg$
- molar mass (atomic mass/atomic weight/molecular weight)
	- $g/mol$
	- each atom has molar mass
	- $CO_{2}$
		- $12.011 g/mol + 2(15.999 g/mol) = 44.009 g/mol$
		- To find molecules in $1g$, 
		- $1g\cdot \frac{mol}{44.009g} \cdot \frac{6.022\cdot 10^{23} \text{molecules}}{mol} = 1.37\cdot 10^{32}$ molecules
