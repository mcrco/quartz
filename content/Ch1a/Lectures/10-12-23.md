- $<R_{e}$ is repulsion between nuclei
- $>R_{e}$ is electrons interacting with both nuclei

# Ionic Bonding

- formed between 2 atoms of differing electronegativity
- example: $NaCl$. electron goes from Na to. Cl
	- IE of Na is 495.8
	- IE of Cl is 1251.2 
	- Cl is 3p orbital but less energy than Na because increased number of protons, but not increased principle quantum number (distance from nucleus)
- atoms that form ions w/ noble gas configurations are very stable
	- NaCl is example once again
	- Na -> Ne, Cl -> Ar
		- $Na \to Na^{+} + e^{-}$, $Cl + e^{-} = Cl^{-}$
	- 8 electorns in valence shell
	- octet rule: atoms with 8 electrons around them are stable
	- general rule
		- Group 1 likes to lose electron -> $A^{+}$
		- Group 2 likes to lose 2 electrons -> $A^{2+}$
		- Group 3 likes to lose 3 electrons -> $A^{3+}$
		- Group 6 likes to gain 2 electrons -> $A^{2-}$
		- Group 7 likes to gain electron -> $A^{-}$

To calculate the change of energy when K bonds with F,

$$
\begin{gather*}
K \to K^{+} + e^{-}, \Delta E = IE_{1}=419 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
e^{-} + F \to F^{-}, \Delta E = -EA = -328 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
V_{\infty} = \Delta E_{\infty} \\
V(R_{KF}) = \frac{q_{K}q_{F}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}R_{KF}} + V_{\infty} \\
\end{gather*}
$$

Basically, the potential energy for a distance of $R_{KF}$ between the two ions in terms of Joules per ion pair is the above. To get it in $\frac{kJ}{mol}$, we need to multiply by Avogadro's number and divide by 1000.

$$
V(R_{KF}) = \frac{q_{K}q_{F}(}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}R_{KF}}\left( \frac{N_{A}}{10^{3}} \right) + V_{\infty}

$$

# Bond Descriptors

## Bond Length

- distance between 2 atoms
- shorter -> stronger

## Energy

- $\Delta E_{d}$ larger = more stable
- reproducible from molecule to molecule
- C-O $\Delta E_{d}$ is $\pm 10\%$
- O-H  $\Delta \epsilon = 465 \frac{kJ}{mol}$

## Order

- number of shared electrons between 2 pairs of atoms
- more electrons = stronger = shorter distance

## Polarity
