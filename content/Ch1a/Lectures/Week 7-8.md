# Hybridization

- orbital is wave function that allows us to understand bonding geometries
- ex: acetylene
	- $H:C:::C:H$
	- $C$ has $sp$ hybridization
- sigma bonds for sp, ...
- pi bonds
	- overlap of $2p$ orbitals

# Transition Metals

### Review of Periodic Trend

- left to right
	- size decreases
	- exception: Mn because of half-filled $3d^{5}$
- f orbitals are diffuse and don't screen charge well
- compared to 5th, 6th period, TM have higher $Z_{eff}$

## Coordinate Bonding

- chelate: ligand that binds $\geq 2$ times to metal
- labile compounds can experience ligand substituion rapidly
- coordination compexes
- structures
	- octahedral
	- isomers

# Crystal Field Theory

- ionic description of metal ligand bonding
- ligands are point charges
- metal d orbitals interact with point charges
- average ligands to spherical fields

# Gas Phase Chemistry

- chemical rxns can occur in gas phase or include gas phase reactants/reagents/products
- gas phase chem crucial for undestanding atmosphere
- air: 70% $N_{2}$, 21% $O_{2}$, 1% $Ar$, 0.04% $CO_{2}$

## Pressure and Temperature

- pressure: force exerted by gas per unit area
- molecules collide with walls of container

$$
P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{ma}{A}
$$

- units: $\frac{kg}{m\cdot s^{2}} = Pa$

### Boyle's Law

$$
P \propto \frac{1}{V}
$$

### Charle's Law

$$
V = V_{0}\left( 1+\frac{T}{273.15^{\circ}\text{C}} \right)
$$

or

$$
V \propto T
$$

## Ideal Gas Law

$$
PV = nRT
$$

- good for gases
	- at low pressure/low density
- empircal law
- ignores interactions between molecules

For mixture of gases,

$$
P_{tot} = P_{A} + P_{B} + P_{C} + \dots
$$

Then,

$$
P_{tot} = (n_{A} + n_{B} + n_{C} + \dots) \frac{RT}{V} = n_{tot} \frac{RT}{V}.
$$

## Kinetic Theory of Gases

1. pure gas $\to$ large amount of identical molecules separated by large distances
2. gas molecules constantly move randomly with distribution speeds
3. move in a straight line between collisions
4. collisions are elastic

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

$$
T \propto \bar{v}
$$

![[Pasted image 20231114114832.png]]

$$
f(v) \approx \text{exp}\left( -\frac{mv^{2}}{2K_{0}T} \right)
$$

- low $v \implies f(v)=1$ 
- high $v \implies f(v)=0$ 

## Real Gas

$$
\frac{PV}{nRT} \neq 1.
$$

- NOT ideal!
- account for interactions between molcecules/intermolecular forces
	- repulsive @ short distances
	- attractive @ long distances

### Corrections to Ideal Gas Law

1. space occupied by gas molecules

$$
P(V-nb) = nRT
$$

2. molecules cluster -> less collisions

$$
P = \frac{nRT}{V-nb} - a\left( \frac{n^{2}}{V^{2}} \right)
$$

# Intermolecular Forces

![[Pasted image 20231116112125.png]]

- van der Waals interaction: attractive and repulsive forces between molecules
- Lennard-Jones potentials
- well depth is small compared to Morse potential
- compared to intramolecular $F$
	- weaker
	- less directional
	- larger range

- London Dispersion Forces
	- nonpolar have instantaneous dipole
	- very weak
	- $V \propto \frac{1}{R^{6}}$
- repulsive force
	- core electrons come close and create repulsion
	- defined van der Waals radii of an atom
	- $V \propto \frac{1}{R^{12}}$

# Phase Transitions

- 3 states of matter: solid, liquid, gas

insert diagram of phase vs molar volume

- solids and liquids exist b/c of intermolecular interactions
- high $T$ gives enough $KE$ to break intermolecular interactions
	- high boiling point $\implies$ strong intermolecular interactions
	- $NaCl$ has high boiling point
	- $He$ has low boiling point
	- $Xe$ has higher bp than $He$ because larger electron cloud -> more polarizable

# Hydrogen Bonding

- hydrogen bonded to $O,N,F$ interact with lone pair on another atom
	- result in very high bp
