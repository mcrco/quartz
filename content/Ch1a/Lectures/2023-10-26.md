# Quantum Mechanics

1. Energy is quantized
2. Wave-particle duality (light like particles, electrons like waves)

## Schrodinger's Equation

$$
\hat{H}\Psi = E \Psi
$$

- $\Psi$ is the electronic wavefunction
	- $(x,y,z,t)$
- $\hat{H}$: set of mathematical instructions called operator
- $E$: total energy of atom
- when we solve Schrodinger's Equation, many solutions of $\Psi$ are characterized by particular $E$
- orbital = specific $\Psi$ solution
- $\Psi^{2}$: probability of finding an electron = probability distribution
- size of orbital: radius that encloses 90% of electron probability distribution
- each $\Psi$ is characterized by set of quantum numbers
	- uses spherical coordinates
	- $\Psi_{nlm}(r,\theta,\phi)$
- $Y$: angular part of $\Psi$
	- given $n$, $Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$ has 2 lobes with + and - phase

insert $Pz$ orbital diagram

$$
\Psi_{nlm}(r,\theta,\phi)=R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi).
$$

## Molecular Orbitals

- quantum picture of a chemical bond
- Morse potential predicts
	- structure
	- vibrations
	- formation

## Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

- electrons move much faster than nuclei
- assume nuclei are fixed in space when solving Schrodinger's equation

$$
2\sigma_{u}^{*}
$$

- 2: integer that tracks relative energies for each symetry type
- $\sigma$: descirbes orientation around internuclear axis
	- $\sigma$: cylindrical symmetry
	- $\pi$: $\Psi$ has nodal plane that contains internuclear axis
- $u$: describes inversion symmetry
	- $u$: ungerade, $g$: gerade
- \*: node on internuclear axis
