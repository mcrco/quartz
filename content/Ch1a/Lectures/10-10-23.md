- Lithium releases more energy than potassium when losing an electron when tossed into water

# Electronegativity

- tendency of an atom to attract share $e^{-}$
	- bonds
	- relative
- increases going up
- increases going right
- example: Cl and Na
	- electron from Na will go to Cl because Cl more stable
	- $Na^{+}Cl^{-}$

## Scales

### Mulliken

$$
EN=\frac{1}{2}C(1E_{1}+EA),
$$

$C$ is a proportionality constant.

### Pauling

$$
EN=\pi
$$

- $\pi$ related to bond dissocation
- A-A
	- perfectly covalent
	- $\Delta E_{AA}$ = bond dissociation E
- B-B
	- $\Delta E_{BB}$ = bond dissociation E
- consider A-B
	- covalent character of A-B = $\sqrt{ \Delta E_{A A} \Delta E_{B B} }$
	- ionic character = $\Delta$ (excess bond energy)
		- $\Delta=\Delta E_{AB}-\sqrt{ \Delta E_{A A} \Delta E_{B B} }$
	- define $\pi$ in terms of $\Delta$
		- $\pi_{A}-\pi_{B}=0.102\Delta^{1/2}$
	- EN diff > 2 = ionic bond
	- EN diff = 0 = covalent bond

# Bonds

- holds atoms together
- change the properties
- care about nature of bond and resulting shapes
	- example: graphene vs polyethylene

Let's consider the simple molecule H2

- forms of energy
	- potential: energy due to position or composition
	- kinetic: motion

## Potential Energy

- energy due to composition or position

$$
V = V_{en}+V_{e e } + V_{nn}
$$

- $V_{en}$ is attractive
- $V_{e e} + V_{nn}$ are repulsive

$$
V = \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{1a}} + \frac{1}{r_{2a}} + \frac{1}{r_{1B} + \frac{1}{R_{2B}}} \right) + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{12}} \right) + \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( \frac{1}{R_{AB}} \right)
$$

## Morse Potential

## Total Energy

$$
E = \sum \text{KE}_{e} + \sum \text{KE}_{n} + V
$$

## Ionic Bond

- complete transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another

## Covalent Bonds

- electrons are shared evenly

## Polar-Covalent Bonds

- gray area between ionic and covalent
- somewhat closer to one atom than another
