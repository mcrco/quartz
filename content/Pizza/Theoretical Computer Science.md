	- run time
	- storage
	- parallelism
	- randomness
- central questions
	- finding solution vs recognizing one (P = NP)
	- is every sequential algo parallelizable (P = NC)
	- can every efficient algo use tiny amount of mem (P = L)
	- small boolean circuits for all problems that require exponential running time
