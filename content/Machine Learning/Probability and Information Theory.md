Probability theory describes uncertain statements. It tells us how AI systems should reason and we can use it to theoretically analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.

# Why Probability

Machine learning uses a lot of uncertain and stochastic quantities. 

Three possible sources:
1. Inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled, such as in a truly random card shuffle
2. Incomplete observability.
3. Incopmlete modeling

It's often better to use a simple but uncertain rule because it's very flexible, such as "Most birds fly" vs "All birds fly except ..."

**Frequentist probability**: probabilities with frequencies/rate of events, such as hands in a card game

**Bayesian probability**: probability dealing with degree of belief in non-repeatable events, such as doctors diagnosing patients.

Probability theory deals with frequency, but we can treat Bayesian probability as behaving the same as frequentist probability.
