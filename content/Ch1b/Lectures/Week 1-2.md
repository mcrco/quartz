# Why Chemistry

- chemistry is interesting (what is blud yapping about)
	- when ammonia molecular structure inverts, electrons pass through 0 probability region (wtf?? actually kinda cool)
	- rate of reaction $\implies$ chemical fatalism?? (what is blud yapping about x2)
- potential to impact humanity
	- $CH_{4}+O_{2}\to CO_{2}+2H_{2}O$
		- capture environmental methane, power UK for a year
	- $N_{2}+3H_{2}\to NH_{3}$
		- 2% of global energy consumption comes from making fertilizer (bruh)
# Organic Chemistry

- study of carbon containing compound
- carbon has great properties for being building block framework
	- can accumulate charge
	- [[Electrons in Atoms#Electronegativity|Pauline Electronegativity]] is intermediate

## Alkanes

- n-alkanes
- cyclic alkanes
- branched-chain

### Normal Alkanes

- also called straight-chain, $n$-alkanes
- all C-H or C-C bonds, fully saturated

![[Pasted image 20240112001817.png]]

- all C are bonded to <2C
	- $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$
- all $C$ are tetrahedral + $sp^{3}$

![[Pasted image 20240112001622.png]]

### Cyclic Alkanes

- cycloalkane: one chain of $C$ attached at ends to form loop

![[Pasted image 20240112001855.png]]

- name: straight chain name + cyclo- at front
- chair conformation:

![[Pasted image 20240112001915.png]]

- boat conformation:

![[Pasted image 20240112001939.png]]

### Branched-Chain Alkanes

- hydrocarbon only containing $C-C$ and $C-H$ single bonds
- 1+ carbon atoms in each molecule is bonded to 3/4 other carbon atoms
- allows for geometrical isomers
	- butane and 2-methylpropane:

![[Pasted image 20240112002322.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240112002330.png]]

- also allows chirality (optical isomerism)
	- one carbon $\to$ 4 different atoms can have mirror images that are not superimposable

![[Pasted image 20240112002630.png]]

- **connection to life: gas at gas station has "octane number"**
	- branched-chain and cycloalkanes combusts smoothly
	- straight-chain alkanes burn unevenly, create knocking that could damge engine
	- octane number based on this

### Nomenclature

1.  named after longest continuous chain
2. group attached to chain is named as -yl vs -ane
3. long chain is named to substituent is the lowest number
4. $>1$ alkyl group of same type use di, tri, etc...
5. several types of alkyl groups, name alphabetically

### Rules for Shorthand

1. all carbons are vertices or points
2. each line is bond
3. assume all $C$ are at octet

## Alkenes and Alkynes

- unsaturated carbon, carbon has double and triple bonds
- alkene: double bond
	- simplest: $C_{2}H_{4}$, ethene
	- bonding shown below
	
- ![[Pasted image 20240112230211.png]]
	
	- naming: replace -ane in corresponding alkane with -ene
	- can have isomeric forms depending on position of bonding groups
	
![[Pasted image 20240112230035.png]]

- polyenes: alkenes with multiple double bonds
	- dienes have 2 double bonds, trienes have 3, etc...
	- double bonds lead to cis and trans conformations
	- examples:

![[Pasted image 20240112231044.png]]

- alkyne: triple bond
	- simplest: $C_{2}H_{2}$, ethyne/acetylene
	- naming: replace -ane in corresponding alkane with -yne
	- bonding shown below

![[Pasted image 20240112230320.png]]

## Aromatic Hydrocarbons

- hexagonal ring of carbon
- simplest example: benzene $C_{6}H_{6}$

![[Pasted image 20240112230513.png]]

- all bonds (single and double) actually have same length
- 6 $p_{z}$ orbitals $\implies$ 6 $\pi$ molecular orbitals

# Connection to Human Health (Januvia)

- Januvia: drug that treats diabetes
- API: Sitagliptin
- unfortunately contained carcinogen from orgo chem reaction used to reduce waste
![[Pasted image 20240110113723.png]]

# Solutions

- **solution**: homogeneous system containing multiple species
- examples
	- $CH_{4}(g)+H_{2}O(l)\to CO(g)+H_{2}(g)$
- $CO_{2}$ in $H_{2}O$
	- solute: $CO_{2}$
	- solvent: $H_{2}O$
- mole fraction: fraction of moles wrt total number of moles

$$
\chi_{1} = \frac{n_{1}}{n_{1}+n_{2}} \quad \chi_{2} = \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}} \implies \chi_{1}+\chi_{2}=1
$$

- concentration: moles per unit volume
- molarity: $M=\frac{\text{moles}}{\text{liters}} = \frac{\text{mol}}{\text{L}}$
- molality: $\frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{kg solvent}}$

## Example Problem

A $60835M$ $AcOH$ ($1M$) has a density of $1.0438\text{g} / \text{mL}$. What is the molality?

1. Assume $1\text{L}$ solution
2. Calculate total mass

$$
P=\frac{M}{V} \implies M=VP = 1\text{L} \left(\frac{1.0438\text{ g}}{\text{mL}}\right)  \left( \frac{1000 \text{ mL}}{\text{L}} \right)
$$

3. Find mass of $AcOH$

$$
6.0835\text{ mol} \left( \frac{60.052\text{ g}}{\text{mol}} \right) = 365.33\text{ g}
$$

4. Find molality

$$
\frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{kg solvent}} = \frac{6.0835\text{ mol}}{365.33\text{ g}} = 8.96 \text{ molal}
$$

## Preparing Solutions

## Nature of Dissolved Species

- non-covalent interactions between solutes and solvents
- solution must replace solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions with solvent-solute interactions

## Reaction Stoichiometry

$$
Cl(\text{aq}) + H \to HCl(\text{aq})
$$

- all have $1M$ molarity
- to balance

$$
MgCl_{2}(\text{aq}) + 2\text{HOTF} \to 2HCl + Mg\text{OTF}2
$$

## Titrations

- quantify a reactive component of a solution
- given $2A+B\to A_{2}B$ and solution with $B$
- we can add solution $A$ until $B$ is consumed
- then calculate moles of $A$ to get $[B]$
- used to determine $[H^{+}], [H_{3}O^{+}]$
	- pH $=-\log[H^{+}]$
- aka **acidity**
- Arrhenius: $2H_{2}O\to H_{3}O^{+}+OH^{-}$
	- disproportionation reaction
	- $[H_{3}O^{+}]=[OH^{-}]=10^{-7}\text{ M}$
	- **acid**: increases $[H_{3}O]$
	- **base**: increases $[OH]$
	- example: phenolphthalein

## Phase Equilibrium in Solution for Non-Volatile Solutes

- vapor pressure of a solution changes with $\chi$
- $\chi_{1}=$ mole fraction of solvent
- $P_{1}^{\circ}=$ vapor pressure of pure solvent
- graph should look like

![[Pasted image 20240112113550.png]]

- **Raoult's Law**: should be straight line
	- $P_{1}=\chi_{1}P_{1}^{\circ}$
	- forms basis for

### Colligative Properties

#### Vapor Pressure lowering

- for a 2-component solution

$$
\begin{gather}
\chi_{1}+\chi_{2}=1\\
\Delta P_{1} = P_{1} - P_{1}^{\circ}=\chi_{1}P_{1}^{\circ}-P_{1}^{\circ}=(1-\chi_{2})P_{1}^{\circ}-P_{1}^{\circ}=-\chi_{2}P_{1}^{\circ}
\end{gather}
$$

#### Boiling Point Elevation

- lower vapor pressure $\implies$ higher BP
- $\Delta T_{b}$: change in BP
- $K_{b}$: constant, table 11.2 in book
- $m$: molarity

$$
\Delta T_{b}=K_{b}m
$$

#### Freezing Point Depression

$$
\Delta T_{f}=K_{f}m
$$

#### Osmotic Pressure

- given semipermeable membrane in solution

$$
\pi=\rho gh
$$
