# LLO for Chapter 12

- familiar with thermo terms
- understand interchange of work and heat
- claculate work for a process to use first law to solve problems
- basic calorimetry
- Hess's law of heat of formation to quantitively describe rxn

# General Definitions

## System

- part of universe under study
- quantity of matter
- **closed system** $\to$ fixed matter
- **open system** $\to$ matter can flow in and out
- **isolated system** $\to$ no flow of energy or matter

## Boundaries

- types of barriers that separate system from surroundings
- rigid walls: prevent energy exchange via work
- non-rigid: allow mechanical energy to be transferred
- adiabatic walls: prevent heat transfer
- diathermal walls: allow heat transfer

# Properties and States

- **thermodynamic state**: condition of system that is maintained by boundaries and surroundings
- **equilibrium state**: thermodynamic system where the proprties don't change w/ time, independent of path
- **thermodynamic processes**: changes in thermodynamic state

# State Function

- properties determined by the thermodynamic state
- independent of path
- $P,V,T,U, \dots \implies \Delta P\Delta V$
- **reversible**: all points on a path are equilibrium states
- **irreversible**: 1 or more points on a path are not equilibrium state

# First Law of Thermodynamics

$$
\Delta U = q+w
$$

## Relation to Classical Mechanics

$$
\begin{align}
w &= F(r_{f}-r_{i}) \\
&= ma(r_{f}-r_{i}) \\
&= m \frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{t}\left( \frac{v_{i}+v_{f}}{2}t \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2} - \frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2} = \Delta \text{KE}.
\end{align}
$$
