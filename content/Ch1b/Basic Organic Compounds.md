# Organic Chemistry

- study of carbon containing compound
- carbon has great properties for being building block framework
	- can accumulate charge
	- [[Electrons in Atoms#Electronegativity|Pauline Electronegativity]] is intermediate

## Alkanes

- n-alkanes
- cyclic alkanes
- branched-chain

### Normal Alkanes

- also called straight-chain, $n$-alkanes
- all C-H or C-C bonds, fully saturated

![[Pasted image 20240112001817.png]]

- all C are bonded to <2C
	- $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$
- all $C$ are tetrahedral + $sp^{3}$

### Cyclic Alkanes

- cycloalkane: one chain of $C$ attached at ends to form loop

![[Pasted image 20240112001855.png]]

- name: straight chain name + cyclo- at front
- chair conformation:

- boat conformation:

### Branched-Chain Alkanes

- hydrocarbon only containing $C-C$ and $C-H$ single bonds
- 1+ carbon atoms in each molecule is bonded to 3/4 other carbon atoms
- allows for geometrical isomers
	- butane and 2-methylpropane:

- also allows chirality (optical isomerism)
	- one carbon $\to$ 4 different atoms can have mirror images that are not superimposable

- **connection to life: gas at gas station has "octane number"**
	- branched-chain and cycloalkanes combusts smoothly
	- straight-chain alkanes burn unevenly, create knocking that could damge engine
	- octane number based on this

### Nomenclature

1.  named after longest continuous chain
2. group attached to chain is named as -yl vs -ane
3. long chain is named to substituent is the lowest number
4. $>1$ alkyl group of same type use di, tri, etc...
5. several types of alkyl groups, name alphabetically

### Rules for Shorthand

1. all carbons are vertices or points
2. each line is bond
3. assume all $C$ are at octet

## Alkenes and Alkynes

- unsaturated carbon, carbon has double and triple bonds
- alkene: double bond
	- simplest: $C_{2}H_{4}$, ethene
	- bonding shown below
	
- ![[Pasted image 20240112230211.png]]
	
	- naming: replace -ane in corresponding alkane with -ene
	- can have isomeric forms depending on position of bonding groups
	
![[Pasted image 20240112230035.png]]

- polyenes: alkenes with multiple double bonds
	- dienes have 2 double bonds, trienes have 3, etc...
	- double bonds lead to cis and trans conformations
	- examples:

![[Pasted image 20240112231044.png]]

- alkyne: triple bond
	- simplest: $C_{2}H_{2}$, ethyne/acetylene
	- naming: replace -ane in corresponding alkane with -yne
	- bonding shown below

## Aromatic Hydrocarbons

- hexagonal ring of carbon
- simplest example: benzene $C_{6}H_{6}$

![[Pasted image 20240112230513.png]]

- all bonds (single and double) actually have same length
- 6 $p_{z}$ orbitals $\implies$ 6 $\pi$ molecular orbitals

# Connection to Real Life

- unsaturated/saturated/cis/trans are also how we described fats (fatty acids)
- saturated and trans unsaturated fats are unhealthy because of compound shape
- strong bonding $\implies$ solid at room temperature, thus clogs arteries

# Connection to Human Health (Januvia)

- Januvia: drug that treats diabetes
- API: Sitagliptin
- unfortunately contained carcinogen from orgo chem reaction used to reduce waste
